# Meeting Minutes
## Week 6: 07.11
### Agenda
1. Sprint results and retrospective
### Discussion
* Low fidelity prototypes feedback:
  * More streamlined onboarding
  * More distinctive colour palette (for low fidelity this is preliminary)
  * Transport preferences differs depending on the time of day
  * A/B Testing suggested
  * Map on homepage should be separated to its own page
  * Sustainability goals need more information, needs a clearer way to quantify carbon emissions results and how the user attained those
  * Positive feedback on written navigation steps, personalisation and integration of rail cards
  * Mixed opinion on detour determination (system-determined vs user-determined)
  * Slider could be more beginner-friendly through a guide as users may not know their baseline
  * Sprouts as a metric is a bit ambiguous and how does it match the theme with dinosaurs?
  * Users appreciate the agency and flexibility of choosing sustainable routes, makes sustainability more accessible
  * High-fidelity prototype: may need to design our own map for personalised icon use to mark sustianable businesses etc.
  * Feedback on High-fidelity -> Requirements first -> Prototyping
* Business Model Canvas:
  * May be worth to look at the slides on Moodle for this to cross-reference and double check
  * TODO:: Show in the next tutorial to verify with tutors
* Top competitors research:
  * Each has their own business recommendation niche: vegatarian places, charity shops, market places
  * Gap in the market: Not many offer recommendations on businesses focussed on sustainability
  * TBC.
