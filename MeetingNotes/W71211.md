# Meeting Minutes
## Week 7: 12.11
### Agenda
1. Sprint results and retrospective
2. Discuss scaling idea down for clearer scope
### Discussion
* Customer segments have different priorities that cover distinct aspects of the app, which is making it difficult to write in detail for the report
  * Corporate responsibility focus offers a more novel market but may need to be generalised but individual enough for those companies, whereas individual focus is a more saturated market
  * Concern for the value proposed for companies: corporate environmental responsibility is relevant, ESG stock value etc.
  * Company-vetted sustainable business marketplace: companies are not going to incentivise employees to use discounts from "competitor" although green companies e.g. Café Nero is not going to encourage a rewards system for their employees to get a discount from another green-certified café
  * The business would act as a mediator between companies and incentivising improving their sustainability score
* Prototype discussions
  *  Trainline has a sustainability story feature we could replicate
  *  Pitstops were well recieved
* Top competitors section
  * On overleaf, sort out multiple zotero referencing to workaround shared overleaf limitations
  * Cross-reference with the spec to evaluate how high-level the comparisons should be
* Business Model Canvas
  * Requires refinements to sections based on the narrowed scope we've discussed today
  * Worth beginning the Value Proposition canvas
* Sustainability-audit to provide a rating or creditation from the business
* Product section descriptions
  * First draft completed but may require refinement, should be integrated to the Overleaf soon
