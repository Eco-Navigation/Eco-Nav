# Meeting Minutes
## Week 2: 08.10
### Agenda
1. Brainstorm ideas for problems to address (find a gap/niche in the market)
2. Brainstorm possible ideas to address these problems
3. Sort out mediums of documentation and communication
### Discussion
1. Problem: Anaesthetic can be expensive and is harder to access in less developed countries
   1. Possible solution: VR solution to supplement the effect 
2. Problem: Students find it difficult to find job relevant skills and experiences that align with their interests and needs
   1. Possible solution: A matching system to connect students with NGOs
3. Problem: Current navigation systems are optimised for the most efficient path without social and environmental considerations (women’s safety, sustainable travel is limited in current implementation)
4. Problem: Interview practice isn’t very personalised using current software and in-person interview training is administratively taxing to facilitate
   1. Possible solution: AI interview live practice and summarised feedback
* Outside of the Wednesday 09:15 tutorial sessions, Mondays 14:00 starting 20.10

Remember:
* Focus on what it does for social impact
* HAS TO BE ETHICAL (if you need to question if it’s ethical it’s probably not)
* Has to have a target audience (customer)

### Action Items
* Bella: Look into VR experience to supplement anaesthetic methods further and try to narrow the scope
* Elizabeth: Look into the idea of a matching system for pairing student with NGOs
* Charlotte: Look into Women’s safety and other social aspects not considered in navigation maps
* Tom: Look into sustainable navigation gaps in current solutions
* Megan: Look into AI interview live and summarised feedback
* Carissa: Look into gaps in the market for LLM wrappers (for nice prototyping 🙂), are there any problems that could be optimised with LLMs?

### Next Meeting
* Discuss research findings
* Decide on three main ideas to pursue

### Additional Notes
* Find a regular meeting area for Monday meetings
* On Moodle, Neil should be uploading links to entrepreneurial projects from previous years
  * Take a look at them to get a good idea of the scope for our project
