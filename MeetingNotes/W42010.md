# Meeting Minutes
## Week 4: 20.10
### Agenda
1. Discuss feasibility, business model and gap in the market for both projects
2. Storm and narrow

### Discussion
* Matching students with NGOs:
  * Clear social focus, but a lot of nuance with existing systems of advertising volunteering opportunities locally in place
  * Narrower opportunities to finance in a way that is cost-neutral
    * Before launch: there is a possible fund that we can use, but options are limited
    * After launch: having ads may deter users that will outweigh any revenue we could accrue from that and donations are not a steady stream of revenue we could use to offset the costs of running and maintaining the platform
    * Many of the unknowns (like supply and demand) may only be fully realised after building the app, which doesn’t align well with the marking specification that requires a lot of clarity for a business plan
* Sustainable Travel:
  * London may be a good focus considering there are more APIs we can access, higher demand for sustainable travel etc.
  * Possible to market to companies to track overall employee carbon emissions to claim tax benefits
  * Have to consider bias when it comes to collaborating with companies
    * Possible solution for this is to have a “speedy slider” so that the user can quantify how much they value speed over sustainability for a given journey to help determine the best route
    * Another possible solution is to have explainable routes, the app tells the user why this route was chosen

### Action Items
* Carissa: Set up Jira Project Management, Gantt Chart, possible retro boards for sprints
* Tom: Set up GitHub environment
* Bella: Set up the Overleaf document
* All: Collate useful links that could benefit future report writing/other research into the problem background

### Next Meeting
* Start structuring our product section

### Additional Notes
* Consistent meeting time has been established to Monday 13:00
