# Meeting Minutes
## Week 3: 15.10
### Agenda
1. Discuss research findings and feasibility to pursue
2. Shortlist project ideas to pursue
### Discussion
* Bella:
  * VR idea has been done before (simulating underwater environments for children 🐠)
  * Classified as a medical approach, therefore there are regulation issues to consider alongside international regulations (medium risk category)
  * Feasibility to test this solution or conduct interviews is low (children are involved, Carissa’s DBS has expired 🙁)
  * Overall cost-wise and expertise-wise too, seems unfeasible for the scope of what’s appropriate for the course
* Tom:
  * Global carbon dioxide emissions are looking rough these days, transport (especially road) is a big factor in this
  * Idea: navigation app that optimises sustainable practices
    * Google maps has a feature for showing the most sustainable route which has already had a positive effect on cutting down emissions
      * But this is only for driving, without consideration to other public transport methods which are also a big player in CO2 emissions
    * Some companies encourage sustainability through employee reward scheme for sustainability
    * Gap in the market: not much incentive outside of time, surface level sustainability optimisation, not an app that has centralised sustainability-focussed travel
  * Existing open source apps makes this a feasible idea
* Elizabeth:
  * Students struggle with finding relevant volunteering experience, NGOs struggle to reach out to volunteers who can help them
  * Manual matching is tedious and time-consuming
  * Current university resources (volunteering opportunities page) is outdated and hard to navigate
    * Volunteering opportunities in the university are mainly communicated through social media or email, many different platforms, would be nice to have as a central hub that’s more personalised
    * Explore ideas for Volunteering experience ratings, friend volunteer matching
    * Target audience: exclusively for matching opportunities to students?
* Megan:
  * Interview practices people are struggling with:
    * Practicing with those you’re comfortable is awkward
    * Practicing with people you don’t know is impersonal
  * Research into existing solutions
    * Voice recording interview: unclear privacy policies
    * Recurring theme of high starting cost with low initial return on investment
    * Video and voice recording with AI interview
      * Generic feedback but interactive process
      * Customising interviews for different environments (friendly interview, high pressure etc.)
  * Throwing around some ideas
    * Personalised company value interview
      * Webscrape values or posted interview questions
    * STAR detection
  * Technical interview opportunity
    * Interactive interviewer during the process
  * Gap in the market: WHAT IF we market it to companies instead 😮to improve interview efficiency and effectiveness
* Charlotte 
  * Route users through safer areas
    * Ethics, would it assume socially deprived areas are less safe?
    * What is considered a safe area?
    * Signup filtering consideration (very finicky)
  * Existing solutions:
    * Life 360
    * Hollie Guard
    * ePower
  * Gap in the market is personalisation but having personalisation comes with a lot of ethics consideration
  * Economic effect on areas classified as unsafe, privacy concerns
* Carissa
  * Longevity of LLM ideas need to be considered, how does it differentiate from what’s already in the market with many LLM based business ideas being reduced to GPT wrappers
  * Environmental impact of LLMs with consideration to ethics, what is the justification of using LLMs for social good?
* Talk with tutor:
  * What’s the revenue stream for NGO student matching? Should at least be cost-neutral for a social enterprise, we need to be careful with not exploiting or misrepresenting the needs of charities

### Action Items
* Further research target ideas towards specification:
  * NGO matching prioritise: Carissa (Feasibility), Charlotte (Business Model), Elizabeth (Gap in the market)
  * Sustainability prioritise: Tom (Costs), Bella (Gap in the market), Megan (Ethics)
* Considerations:
  * Costs: must be cost neutral at least
  * Ethics: How are we going to make sure we are ethical
  * Potential users: Who are our target audience, can we conduct interviews and testing, how are we going to get feedback?
  * Feasibility: Is this project feasible within the scope of the coursework assessment criteria 

### Next Meeting
* Collate our research
* Narrow down our focus
