# Meeting Minutes
## Week 4: 22.10
### Agenda
1. Establish out workflow
2. Start sprinting 🏃
### Discussion
* Target Market Ideas:
  * Large companies who want to report reduced emissions through their employees’ travel, with employees incentivised through point redemption system
    * Or companies/firms who want to greenwash/show that they are green for clout
  * Environment-conscious individuals interested in reducing/tracking their carbon footprint (with community comparison)
  * Individuals interested in the sustainability of different travel options/routes
  * Students, tourists, possibly retired people???
* User personas:
  * User 1:
    * Cool CS student
    * Vegetarian
    * As a young, environmentally conscious, student, Elizabeth wants to become more aware of her carbon footprint and find sustainable local businesses. The deals don’t hurt either!
  * User 2:
    * Enterprise MD
    * Is head of sustainability for UK and needs to drastically cut down carbon emissions after a scathing guardian article
    * Lots of money and wants to offset carbon
    * As a business leader, I want reportable data and insights on my employees cutting their business travel emissions so that we can become a greener company :)
  * User 3:
    * Is the owner of a local sustainable cat cafe (with rescue cats!)
    * Struggling to compete with larger national chains, and can’t afford to ply google with money to put her at the top of the SEO
    * As a local business owner, Megan wants to improve her exposure to her market so that more people who care about sustainability find her business and she attracts more customer $$$
* Feature Ideas
  * Carbon emission tracking 
  * Leaderboards for individuals (companies???)
  * Centralised reporting of emissions for companies to monitor sustainability goals
  * Inbuilt carbon offsetting partnership?
  * Affiliation program for local businesses with sustainable practices highlighted to users
  * Efficiency improvement buddy: suggests more sustainable ways to change your commute (e.g. switch to biking instead of taking the bus)
  * May target car users
  * Area analytics: how much emissions the community/friends reduced to show community effect in being more sustainable
  * Fuel efficient vs faster routes
  * Graph of emissions over time
  * Option to set a max “carbon cap” for the week/set time period
  * In app (virtual badges, avatar customisation) and real (redeeming carbon points for gift cards/discounts at partnered businesses) gamified rewards for users travelling more sustainably
  * Travel preference filters
  * Partnered sustainable businesses have different icons to stand out
    * Program where they pay a fixed fee every month
    * Sustainability certification
  * Explainable alternate routes
  * Alarms for the most economical travel times/when to leave to have enough time to take sustainable routes
* Revenue Ideas:
  * Freemium model with premium features: e.g. AI, more varied loyalty program, in-depth reporting, less ads
  * Businesses pay per user/employee or estimated by company size
  * Could pay for carbon credits generated by the app (would be at a lower price than the market rate)
  * Potential for carbon credits (partnership with a carbon offset company)
  * Affiliate program (monthly fee to be boosted and through loyalty program)
